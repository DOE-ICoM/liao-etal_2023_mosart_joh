# Planning

\subsection{Key points (some overlaps with Chang's other papers, need \textcolor{red}{discussion})}
\begin{itemize}
\item This paper demonstrates river routing over unstructured mesh within ESM framework
\item Compares with traditional lat-long routing scheme. (not aiming to improve routing performance in terms of hydrograph accuracy)
\item To hydrology community, this is a novel mesh-independent river routing approach, we are able to burn the river network and points such as dams and gages into the mesh (first time).
\item To ESM community, we are building a bridge between ESM and regional modeling by using variable resolution mesh. First time for river processes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experiment design}
\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1: prepare runoff dataset (Ming Pan) (Depend on step 3)
\item Step 2: river network dataset preparation(identify a few basins across spatial scales, with good discharge data). tentatively ICoM basins, one or two Arctic basins, Columbia, and maybe a few large basins on other continents (Need more \textcolor{red}{discussion}).

ICoM: 1/16, 1/8, MPAS

CRB: 1/8, 1/2, MPAS

Sag: 1/16, MPAS

\item Step 2.5: run pyflowline (optional) stream burning 
\item Step 3: MPAS mesh generation (Need more \textcolor{red}{discussion} about resolution, w/ or w/o stream burning, etc.)
\item Step 4: Run hexwatershed, get river network
\item Step 5: Generate MOSART parameter using Donghuiâ€™s script
\item Step 6: run MOSART over both MPAS and lat-long configurations
\item Step 7: Analyses (Need more \textcolor{red}{discussion} about metrics, etc.)
\end{itemize}
